# 📂 Milenial Docs

This repository contains legal, strategic, and narrative disclosures that support Milenial Inc.’s development of a dual-system Compliance-as-a-Service (CaaS) and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) platform.

These foundational documents clarify our vision, protect our intellectual property, and document the intentional equity-driven approach guiding our SBIR and federal procurement strategy.
